<p><strong>Objective:</strong> <br><br>Write JavaScript code that provides clothing advice based on the current temperature. This exercise will help you learn how to use different types of conditional statements effectively.</p>
<h4>Tasks:</h4>
<ol>
<li>Define a variable&nbsp;<code>temperature</code> and set it to any integer to represent the temperature in degrees Celsius.</li>
<li>Use <code>if/else</code> to advise wearing a coat if the temperature is below 15 degrees.</li>
<li>Use <code>if/else if/else</code> to give advice based on three temperature ranges:
<ul>
<li>Below 15 degrees: suggest a coat.</li>
<li>Between 15 and 25 degrees: suggest a sweater.</li>
<li>Above 25 degrees: suggest a t-shirt.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Use a <code>switch</code> statement to provide advice based on specific temperatures (just a few for example): 10, 20, and 30 degrees.</li>
<li>Print the results for each task to the console.</li>
</ol>
<p>Play with different values for <code>temperature</code> and different scenarios!</p>
