<p><strong>Objective:</strong></p>
<p>Write JavaScript code to count animals in a zoo. You will use different types of loops to count the same list of animals, helping you understand the nuances and applications of each loop type.</p>
<p><strong>Tasks:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Use a <code>for</code> loop to count the total number of animals.</li>
<li>Use a <code>while</code> loop to count animals whose names have five or more letters. You can check the<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/length" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> length of a string&nbsp;</a></li>
<li>Use a <code>do...while</code> loop to count animals until you encounter an animal whose name starts with 'm'</li>
</ol>
<p>Yes, yes, we could do this with array methods! But those declarative approaches use these basic loop constructs under the hood! So we better learn them! ðŸ˜Š</p>
